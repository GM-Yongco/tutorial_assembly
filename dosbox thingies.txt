In x86 assembly, only certain registers can be used as index registers
	SI (Source Index) and DI (Destination Index) are commonly used as index registers.
	BX and BP can also serve as base registers in memory addressing.
	AX, CX, DX, and SP cannot be used as index registers in most addressing modes.
ex code
	MOV AL, 'a'
	mov ds, 0b800h
	mov cl, 0
	mov b[ds:cl], AL
	~          ^
	#ERROR 39: Bad Index Register
